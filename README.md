Data Visualization Credit Sales
# Project Description(https://github.com/Jusepi-Y): 
I conducted a credit sales analysis for a private advanced medical laboratory center that offers 256 different lab tests. I used data from the past nine months for clients who have credit agreements with the center. I used Power BI as my tech stack to showcase my skills in data extraction, data cleaning, data transformation and visualization.

# Project Approach: 
I evaluated various attributes of the data, such as credit amount for each test type, customer, date in months and year. I used DAX to create measures such as total credit and average credit. I also created interactive dashboards and charts to visualize the data and highlight the key insights.

# Insights: 
The credit sales trend showed a peak in March and an 80% reduction in April due to low referrals from the four biggest suppliers. The total credit sales for the nine months was 28 million. The average credit per test type varied from 100 to 500. The top 10 customers accounted for 60% of the total credit sales.

# Data Visualization: 
I used various types of charts and graphs to display the data, such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and maps. I also used slicers and filters to allow users to explore the data interactively. Here are some examples of my data visualizations:
